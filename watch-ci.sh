# Usage: ./watch-ci.sh [ref] [workflow]   (defaults: HEAD, ci.yml)
#
# The run is selected by workflow AND commit SHA. Selecting with
# `--branch ... --limit 1` reads whatever ran most recently on the branch, which
# is not necessarily the commit being released. `gh run watch` also exits 0 on a
# failed run unless given --exit-status.
#
# A run does not exist the instant a push returns, so the id is polled for.
